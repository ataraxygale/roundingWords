# 🧮 roundingWords
Halving words and printing the output

## 📦 Notes
- This is part of a growing set of small programs documenting my Python learning journey.
- ⚙️✨

## 🧠 How It Works
- Prompts the user to input a word to be halved
- Calculates the first and second halves of the word
- Outputs the results

## 🧪 Example Output
```
As a list:  ['a', 'm', 'a']
As a string:  ama
As a list:  ['z', 'i', 'n', 'g']
As a string:  zing

Process finished with exit code 0
```
